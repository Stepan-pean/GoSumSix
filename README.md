# GoSumSix
Create a game, demo, simple project.

In February 2018, I got an exciting idea of game (with mathematical rules). So, “GoSumSix” is a project how to realize the game (maybe for Win/Linux/Android). Because I’m a bachelor of math and physics, not programmer, first, I'm trying to create the demo by one of game editor (with easy programming).

I said myself: "Might be fun to create a game using only GeoGebra, Gimp and Godot (=GGG)." :D

Purpose: Create the demo, as fast as I can. Of course I will be glad for your help.

Project GoSumSix is on Facebook, too. https://www.facebook.com/gosumsix/
